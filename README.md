# Basic-Auth 🔐

Basic-Auth is an object lesson of an OAuth 2.0 protocol integration on a very basic Node.JS API. I made it for learning purposes, so feel free 
to tell me anything that can improve this setup ! 🙃

# Installation

To start, just clone this repository and then use: 

```bash
yarn install # or using npm: npm install
```

Before starting the node server, be sure to have a `.env` file containing at least the following code: 

```bash
secretKey=[A RANDOM SECRET KEY OF YOUR CHOICE]
```

Then just run the following start command: 

```bash
yarn start # or using npm: npm start
```

Your node server is now by default listening on port 3000
